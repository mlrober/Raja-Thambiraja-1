The below line is mentioned for "Sedate Yin and Tonify Yang" with Yuan in Yin & Luo in Yang, is it not reverse? if Yin is deficient?
This imbalance may be in a Yin organ or its coupled Yang organ, the same
points would used to bring them to balance
==========================================

Queries:
Heart receives impure blood and is purified by lungs but author says blood is sent from kidney to lungs directly
Husband Points for Tonification

NEVER SEDATE KIDNEY & URINARY BLADDER (Ex. K1) which impacts the bone growth and function of kidney is hampered for a quite time

Tai Yin (Greater Yin)
- Lungs & Spleen
- Large quantity of YIn and functional Yin
Shao Yin (Lesser Yin)
- Heart & Kidney
- Since they work heavily and supports most of the Yang aspects
Jue Yin (Extreme Yin)
- Pericardium & Liver
- It can go beyond the level
Tai Yang
- Small Intestine & Urinary Bladder
Shao Yang
- Triple Warmer & Gall Bladder
YangMing
- Large Intestine & Stomach

Reproduction
- Kidney Yang

Needling
- Needle Sensation will increase the effect

Tonify kidney with earth point

Depth or level of energy in channel
- In Warm Weather or Yang Disease, the acupuncture point will ascend and become very large
- In winter or Yin Disease, the acupoint will descend and sinks deep in muscles and hard to locate, hence use moxa to increase Yang QI.

Vital Energy (QI)
Vital Essence (jing)
Blood (xue)
Body Fluid (Jin Ye)
- 2 types Thin & Thick
	- Thin
		- Cerebro-spinal, urine, sweat, saliva, tears, watery mucus etc.
		- Excessive thin fluid means excessive Yin in affected organ and perhaps in kidney
		- Less Fluids means Yin Deficiency in affected organ and perhaps kidney
		- Ex. Dry Eyes -> Liver Yin Deficiency & kidney Yin Deficiency
		- Thin fluids can be influenced by water + Salt intake or decreasing salt
		- Points to improve diuresis
			- Sp9, UB23, UB58
		- Mu-front point of related organ to clear dryness and moisturze
		- Tonify kidney with k7 or k10
	- Thick
		- Blood, Lymph, thick Mucus and various thick fluid discharges
		- Excessive thick fluid means Excessive dampness in affected organ and spleen
		- E.g. Excessive mucus or swollen joint means excessive damp stagnation in affected organ & spleen QI deficiency
		- Thick fluids may be watery by increasing or decreasing salt
		- localized fluids can be eliminated by improving spleen function
		- Points to cure diuretic
			- SP10, UB23, Ub58
		- Mu-front points to cool & moisturize related organ that makes thick fluid watery

Vital Essence (Jing)
- stored by Kidney Yin
Vital Energy (QI)
- Made by Kidney Yang

Blood is
-Yin
	- Fluid
	- has nutrients
- Yang
	- Flowing
	- Circulates entire body to spread warmth
	- If there is excessive heat in a part of body which can't be reduced with Yin, then bleeding the blood will release and reduce heat

Food+Drink -> stomach -> spleen -> kidney -> bone marrow (produces blood) -> lung/heart - > spleen

Food+Drink-> stomach
- Pure substances -> spleen (stores some part and sends remaining) -> kideny -> split the fluid into 2 parts -> separates nutrients from one part & pass the fluid to form bone marrow -> form blood (white blood or plasma (doesn't contain any nutrients) -> sends nutrients, spleen fluid, plasma -> lungs -> mixes oxygen -> heart (synthesize red blood)
- Impure substances

Energy Balancing Points
- Mu-Front & Back-shu points
	- Points that are directly on the organs to influence
	- Points that increase the quality of energy but no tquantity of organs
Mu-front
- Found as pain point (Alarm) and located on anterior surface of the organ
- Pain on anteriror surface, when needled will treat the dysfuntion and alleviate the pain
- Uses
	- Alarm point can be treated to influence Yin aspect of the organ as in Yin (front) surface
	- Tonifies Yin of organ
	- local point of organ
- Quality of Yin is to COOL & CALM
Back-shu
- located on the posterior surface of the organ
- Organ dysfunction may cause +ve reaction (tenderness, muscle tension, cystic nodules)on posterior surface of the organ
- when needled, the +ve reaction will dismiss
- Uses
	- this point can be treated to influence Yang aspect of the organ as in Yang (back) surface
	- Tonifies Yang of organ
	- local point of organ
- Quality of Yang is to FUNCTION & WARM
MU-front and Back-shu points

Points that influence Quantity of Energy Flow
- Energy can flow from Yin organ to Yin organ or Yang organ
- Energy from Yin organ will always be Yin nature thought it flows to Yang organ it remains Yin and increases the flow of Yin energy of other organ
- No points to influence deeper energy flow

Couple Organs - Interior Relationship Deep Energy Circulation
Interior Relationship Deep Energy Circulation
- Lung & Large Intestine Channel
	- Energy flow from interior lung to exterior large intestine
	- Both has interior and exterior aspect of it
	- Lu Yang flows to LI Yang & vie versa
	- LU Yin flows to LI Yin and Vice versa
Excess States
- Lu Yin increases and LI Yin is normal. Lu Yin flows through interior meridian to Large Intestine
- Lu Yin Excess
	- Yin excess in Lung will manifest as fullness and excess mucus
	- Yin excess in LI will manifest as watery stools
	- Lu5 Lung Meridian Sedation Point
	- Sedation of Lu5 will disperse most of the house energy of Lu Yin energy to another organ
	- Approximately 90% of Yin and only 10% of Yang will be dispersed
	- Through interior meridian, Yin of Large Intestine is flown to Lungs and the energy level will be same
- Lu Yang Excess
	- Yang excess in Lungs will flow to LI and causing colic, painful stools
	- Li2 Large Intestine Meridian Sedation Point
	- Sedation Li2 will disperse excess Yang house energy from LI
	- As the couple organ, the Yang energy from Lu will flow through interior meridian to LI and the energy is balanced
Deficiency States
- Lu Yin Deficiency
	- Dry skin, dry nose or throat
	- Tonify Lu Yin Directly
		- Lu1 (mu-front) & Lu9 (Tonification Point)
		- Both should be needled as one increases quality and other quantity of energy
		- Lu9 tonifies both Yin & Yang with more Yin as Yin organ
		- More of Yin & less of Yang (90:10)
- Lu Yang Deficiency
	- chronic blocked nose, cannot sweat, chronic asthma in wet, cold weather
	- As Lu Yang is deficient, LI with normal amount of Yang will flow to Lu and try to full the deficiency
	- Li11 tonifies more of Yang (90:10) which fill the LI and automatically flow to LU and stops once energy levels are same
	- Directly tonifies Li Yang & indirectly tonifies Lu Yang
- Functional Yang (QI) Deficiency of Urinary Bladder
	- Problem in starting and stopping the urination, controlling and emptying the bladder
	- UB67 + Tonification Point Increases Quantitative Energy (Increases Yang 90:10)
	- UB28 (Back-shu Point of UB) Improves function
- UB Yin Deficiency
	- Frequent & little Urination, urgency, buring
	- Tonifty Kidney Yin with K7 as tonification point
	- Ren3 (Mu-front for UB) - to improve cooling and calming quality of Yin
- Wish to increase Yin in coupled organs (either Yin or Yang), always tonify Yin organ with mu-front point of organ
- Wish to increase Yang in couple organs, always tonify Yang tonification point of organ with Back-shu point of organ

SuperFicial Energy Circulation
- Flows between skin & muscles and has its own points
- Energy changes polarity in exteriror meridian when flowing from Yang to Yin and vice versa based on environment
Coupled Organs - Exterior Relationship
- Lu Yin Deficiency & Yang Excess
	- Thin & Dry Skin with redness and inflamation
	- As Yin & Yang flow in exterior meridian of ventral-medial & dorsal-lateral, they have different polarity like cool & hot and in energy flow as well due to climate on that area
	- Sedate Li4 (Yuan) - sedates Yang from LI directly and Lu Yang indirectly
	- Tonify Lu7 - tonifies Lu Yin directly and LI Yin indirectly
	- Energy will flow from LI (Decrease Yang and convert to Yin) to Lu increases Yin
- Stomach Yin Deficiency & Yang Excess
	- Diagnosis: Gastric Ulcer
	- Hyperacidity, burning pain when hunger, intolerance to hunger, excessive thirst, preference to cool drinks
	- Sedate St42 - sedates stomach yang directly and Spleen Yang indirectly
	- Tonify Sp21 - Tonifies spleen Yin directly and stomach Yin indirectly
	- Stomach Yang flow into spleen Yin and changes polarity
Kidney Yin excess and Yang Deficient
- Generalised oedema with little urination indicates weakness of kidney function as it is responsible for elimination of fluid
- Sedate K3 - sedates kidney Yin directly and UB Yin indirectly
- Tonify UB58 - tonifies UB Yang directly and Kidney Yang indirectly
Spleen Yin Excess Dampness and Function QI Deficient
	- odema of face, lower arms & legs, with stiffness and pain in joints mostly in mornings. Pheripheryl odema is a weakness of spleen function deficiency in circulating fluid.
	- Sedates SP3 - sedates spleen Yin directly and Stomach indirectly
	- Tonify St40 - tonfies Stomach Yang directly and Spleen Yang indirectly



Yuan Source Point
- Point where the energy flows out of a meridian & flow into the coupled meridian
- Exit Gate
- Yuan points are connected to the source of energy of the body
- In Yin organs, Mother Earth and nutrients flow to all parts of body and all earth points are Yuan Source Points.
- All earth points of Yin organs are Yuan source Points
- Most powerful point with connections to many other organs and binding point of a meridian

Luo-Connecting Point
- Point of Yang organ tonifies its Yang and sedates Yin
- Point where the energy flows into in the meridian
- Point of energy
- INDICATION: Its 'One-up arrow and one-down arrow'
- Entry Gate

Luo-Connecting - Which way energy flows?
- As per west, energy goes out from luo-connecting
- As per chinese, Yuan source of first diseased organ and luo-connecting of 2nd affected one
- There is no specific definition of how energy flows in yuan & luo-connecting
- Ex. St40 will reduce excess mucus -> reducess Yin and increases Yang
- GB37 gives "Bright Sight" and increase function, Yang energy
- Lu7 Increases Yin energy and confluent for Ren channel
- P6 Increases Yin energy by calming the body and vomiting
- Above points are needled separately not clubbed with Yuan source
- Examples shows to improve Yin energy use Luo of Yin channel and to increase Yang energy use Luo of Yang channel

Organ Clock TIme
- Each organ has its own time and during the time, the energy is in peak of that organ.
- Organ clock can be leveraged to get highest energy on a particular meridian using their horary points
- Ex. Lu8 Lung metal point, Sp3 Earth point
Excess Energy of organ
- Any worsen symptoms during this period reflects excess of Yin/Yang of that organ
- Need to find it with more conditions and other aspects of the sysmptoms
Lowest Energy of Organ
- Person woke up due to any symptoms and can't sleep till the time moves out reflects the deficiency of the opposite organ
- Ex. Person has backache during 3-4, it reflects Urinary Bladder Yin/Yang is deficient and he can't sleep untill 5 am.

Organ Clock - Entry & Exit Points
- As per Organ clock, the energy will not always exit from exit point, it is possible to exit even before that.
- To balance this in easy way, sedate exit point and tonify entry point of organ
- Ex. For obesity, sedate Sp21 exit point & tonfiy H1 Entry point of heart
- Same rule can be used for all organs and has similar effect of luo-connecting points

## Mother-Son Law
- This law helps to tonify Yin of Organ or Yang of Yang organ
- Tonify or Sedation needling technique to tonify or sedate the organ
- Tonification in Mother-Son Cycle increases House Energy
- Sedation Point sedates "House Energy"
- If there is energy block on mother point, it will reflect in son point
- Helps tonify the child organ
- If there is deficient in both mother & son, tonify mother alone which tonifies son and not needed to tonify both separately
- Tonification of mother points will increase both Yin & Yang of the organ though it can increase house energy only
Tonification
- Mother Point of each meridian can be used as a tonification point
Sedation
- Son Point of each meridian can be used as a sedation point

## Controlling Cycle
- This law helps to tonify Yang of Yin organ or Yin of Yang Organ
- Tonify or Sedation needling technique to tonify or sedate the organ
Tonification
- Tonification in this Cycle tonifies more of Opposite Polarity
- E.g. Lu10 with Tonify Technique
	- Tonifies Yang of Lung
	- SI, TW will send Yang to Lungs
- E.g. GB44 with Tonify technique
	- Lung will send Yin to Gall Bladder
Sedation
- Sedation in this Cycle sedates more of Opposite Polarity
- Sedation Point sedates more of "House Energy" only
- E.g. SI1 with sedation technique
	- Lung will receive Yang Energy
- E.g. LU11 with Sedation technique
	- Gall Bladder will receive energy
- E.g. Gall Bladder can send energy in two directions -> Fire Points & Earth Points
- TO sedate GB, use GB38 or GB34
- E.g. In Migrane headeache, patient is resltess in night and hyper in day time. Reflects Yang Dominant of Heart. Hence Sedate GB34 to send energy to earth rather heart which is already excess

## Counter-Powering Cycle
- Process of Reverse to control cycle
- One Element with Deficiency and can't control the other but this element controls partner with its excess energy
- As per controlling cycle, Lu to control GB due to Yin deficiency Lu can't control and GB raises and controls Lu Yin

Diagnosis
- Tranquillizing points: Du 20, Extra 6, Good Night point 1, P 6, UB 62
Add the following points to the above:
- Heart Yin deficiency – Ren 14 (Mu-front point), H 8 (House-element point)
- Heart Fire – H 5 (Luo point) and sedation of SI 4 (Yuan-source point)
- Heart Blood and Qi deficiency – Ren 14, UB 15 (Shu point), H 9, SI 3, UB17 (Influential point – Blood), Sp 10 (Sea of Blood), GB 39 (Influential point – Marrow)
- Kidney Yin deficiency – K 7 (Tonification point)
- Heart Yin/Blood stagnation – UB 15 (back-Shu point), SI 7 (Luo point), K 6 (Wake up point for hypersomnia)
